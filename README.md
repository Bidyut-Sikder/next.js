This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```
## Note 
### We used dummy_data and no Async function in this project that's why it runs well on vercel.

## Topics
In this section we have seen how routing(app router) works in next.js project.
