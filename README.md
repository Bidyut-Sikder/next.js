## Topics
In this section we have seen how to Fetch data in  Page Router  in next.js project.

## Features 
- [x] getStaticProps()
- [x] getStaticPaths()

- [x] getServerSideProps()

## Note
And we could use getStaticProps() to pre-render  and useEffect() to fetch data at the same time  in next.js project (server side and client side rendering at the same time).
